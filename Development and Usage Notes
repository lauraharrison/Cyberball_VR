Notes 3/14/17
If you open the scene BedroomCharacters under the folder: Assets\Brain you will find our latest integration.
Currently you can move around as a standard first person controller(mouse+asdw keys) and throw the ball to either
-the left (letter "j" in the keyboard) 
-or the right person (letter "L" in the keyboard)

You will notice we have decent animations from mixamo for walk, run, idle, waving and throwing. 
The only animation different for the man or woman is the walk cycle, but we are also planing to have more than one idle, 
alternating them to have a more natural feeling.

We are using a kind of handshake as "catch" but you will notice the timing to actually catch the ball is not well tuned. 
I did not want to spend time tuning it because it is just temporary. I imported the model to maya and I am doing some 
tests to create a better catch animation.
